I am an experimental particle physicist at [Paul Scherrer Institute PSI](https://psi.ch),
Switzerland's largest research institute for natural sciences and engineering,
working on the [CMS experiment](https://cms.cern/) at the CERN
[Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider).

My research interests lie in:

- Physics analysis (in particular in connection with the use of jet
  substructure for heavy resonance searches or precision quantum
  chromodynamics measurements)
- Pixel detectors (operation and upgrade)
- Computing (large-scale high throughput systems, cloud computing, analysis
  tools, automation)
- Open Science (analysis reproducibility, open research data)

At PSI, together with [Andy Adelmann](https://www.psi.ch/en/lsm/people/andreas-adelmann),
I reinstated and reshaped the
[PSI Summer Student Programme](https://www.psi.ch/en/summerstudents),
which in 2025 had more than 50 participants.
