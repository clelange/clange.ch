Inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) and since I am also generally
interested in what other people are using, I list below things that I use
on a regular basis.

## Editor and Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as editor with
  [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html) as terminal replacement
- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)

## Desktop Apps

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking and organisation
- [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/) to run Docker containers

## Computers

My current work horse is an Apple Macbook Pro M1 with 32 GB RAM and 1 TB disk.
