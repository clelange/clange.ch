Inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) and since I am also generally
interested in what other people are using, I list below things that I use
on a regular basis.

## Editor and Terminal

## Desktop Apps

## Computers

My current work horse is an Apple Macbook Pro M1 with 32 GB RAM and 1 TB disk.
