Here is a list of projects that I created and try to maintain.

## CDS Paper Bot

URL: <https://github.com/clelange/cds_paper_bot/>

I created a bot that parses the
[CERN Document Server (CDS)](https://cds.cern.ch/) for new results from the
ATLAS ([{{< icon "x-twitter" >}}](https://x.com/ATLASpapers)),
CMS ([{{< icon "x-twitter" >}}](https://x.com/CMSpapers), [{{< icon "bluesky" >}}](https://bsky.app/profile/cmspapers.bsky.social), [{{< icon "mastodon" >}}](https://mastodon.social/@cmspapers)),
and LHCb ([{{< icon "bluesky" >}}](https://bsky.app/profile/cmspapers.bsky.social))
collaborations and turns them into posts on social media.

## hepdata_lib

`hepdata_lib` is a Python library for getting your data into [HEPData](https://hepdata.net/).
